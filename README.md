ðŸŽ¨ Just a Fun Little Portfolio
Made this for fun â€” no job hunting, no flexing, just vibes.
It has 2 whole pages (yes, TWO) â€” a homepage and a form. Thatâ€™s it. No JavaScript, no backend, no drama.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stuff
HTML â€“ because thatâ€™s how websites exist

CSS â€“ just enough to make it not look like it was made in 2005

ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s Inside?
Home Page â€“ Where I pretend to introduce myself like a professional

Form Page â€“ You can fill it out, but it doesnâ€™t actually do anything (yet)

ðŸ§ª Why?
Because I was bored and wanted to make something cool-looking. Mission accomplished. ðŸ˜Ž
