                <h2 class="b__title">About Me</h2>
                <p class="b__description">Hey there! I’m Jeofroi Correya, a full stack web developer who writes code
                    that
                    actually works (most days). I specialize in building clean, responsive front-ends and reliable
                    back-ends
                    — basically the kind of apps that don’t fall apart when someone clicks too fast.

                    I didn’t take the usual college-to-cubicle route — dropped the textbook life, chose the terminal,
                    and
                    dove into full stack development like it owed me money. Currently mastering the art of writing
                    functional code while silently battling semicolons and unnecessary bugs (a.k.a. features that
                    weren’t
                    invited).

                    I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python — or as I like to call it, the survival kit
                    for
                    modern developers. I’ve handled real clients, real deadlines, and real bugs that somehow only appear
                    right before demos. It builds character. And anxiety.

                    Beyond code, I’ve got experience in customer support, so I’m basically trained in debugging both
                    software and human emotions. Not to brag, but I’ve calmed down more angry users than most fire
                    extinguishers.

                    When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me geeking out over superheroes, planning food business ideas
                    I’ll
                    launch after 17 side projects, or pretending to fix “just one last bug” at 3 a.m. (Spoiler: it was
                    never
                    just one.)

                    I believe in clean code, clear logic, dark mode, and not shipping anything that I wouldn't be proud
                    to
                    show my future self (or my dog, if I had one).</p>
